        Short Description: <br> 
        <br> 
        Frieren is a long-lived,
        immortal elven mage who once defeated the Demon King with a party of heroes.
        After the quest,
        she takes a second journey to better understand humanity,
        which she sees as fleeting,
        and to process the death of her former companions,
        particularly the human hero Himmel.
        The series,
        Frieren: Beyond Journey's End,
        follows her as she travels with a young apprentice,
        Fern, reflecting on life, time,
        and the meaning of human relationships.
